# (PART) Supervised Models {-}

A classification problem can be defined as the induction, from a dataset $\cal D$, of a classification function $\psi$ that, given the attribute vector of an instance/example, returns a class ${c}$. A regression problem, on the other hand, returns an numeric value.

Dataset, $\cal D$, is typically composed of $n$ attributes and a class attribute $C$. 

| $Att_1$  | ... | $Att_n$  | $Class$ |
|----------|-----| ---------|---------|
| $a_{11}$ | ... | $a_{1n}$ | $c_1$   |
| $a_{21}$ | ... | $a_{2n}$ | $c_2$   |
| ...      | ... | ...      | ...     |
| $a_{m1}$ | ... | $a_{mn}$ | $c_m$   |


Columns are usually called _attributes_ or _features_. Typically, there is a _class_ attribute, which can be numeric or discrete. When the class is numeric, it is a regression problem. With discrete values, we can talk about binary classification or multiclass (multinomial classification) when we have more than three values.


There are variants such _multi-label_ classification (more later).
