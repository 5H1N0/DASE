Problem Understanding\n  2. Data Understanding\n  3. Data Preparation\n  4. Modeling\n  5. Evaluation\n  6. Deployment\n\n## The Aim of Data Analysis and Statistical Learning\n  - The aim of any data analysis is to  **understand the data** \n  - and to build models for making predictions and estimating future events based on past data\n  - and to make statistical inferences from our data.\n  - We may want to test different hypothesis on the data\n  - We want to generate conclusions about the population where our sample data comes from\n  - Most probably we are interested in building a model for quality, time, defects or effort prediction\n    \n  ![](../figures/prediction.png)\n  \n  - We want to find a function *f()*, that given X1, X2, ...  computes *Y=f(X1, X2, ..., Xn)*\n\n\n## Basic References \n\nGeneric books about statistics:\n\n  * [John Verzani, *simpleR - Using R for Introductory Statistics*](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Verzani-SimpleR.pdf)\n  \n  * [Peter Dalgaard, *Introductory Statistics with R*, 2nd Edt., Springer, 2008](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387790534)\n\n  * [Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R*, Springer, 2013](http://www.springer.com/it/book/9781461471370)\n\n  * [Geoff Cumming, *Understanding the New Statistics: Effect Sizes, Confidence Intervals, and Meta-Analysis*, Routledge, New York, 2012](https://www.routledge.com/products/9780415879682)\n    \n\nData Mining with R\n\n  * [Graham Williams, *Data Mining with Rattle and R: The Art of Excavating Data for Knowledge Discovery*, Springer 2011](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781441998897)\n  \n    Also the author maintains a Web site:\n    [http://rattle.togaware.com/](http://rattle.togaware.com/)\n  \n  * [Luis Torgo, *Data Mining with R: Learning with Case Studies*, Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2010](https://www.crcpress.com/Data-Mining-with-R-Learning-with-Case-Studies/Torgo/9781439810187)\n  \n  * [http://www.rdatamining.com/](http://www.rdatamining.com/)\n  \n  \nData Mining with Weka\n\n  *  Ian Witten, Eibe Frank, Mark Hall, Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, MK 2011, ISBN: 978-0-12-374856-0\n\n\n\n\n## References\n\n",
