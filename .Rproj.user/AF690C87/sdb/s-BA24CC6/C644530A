The sampling distribution of the sample mean is normally distributed meaning that the \"mean of a representative sample provides an estimate of the unknown population mean\".\n```{r}\nhist(sample.means)\n```\n\n\n\n## Getting the Data. Descriptive statistics.\n  - Set the path to your files \n  - Read the Telecom1 dataset and print out the summary statistics with the command *summary*\n```{r}\noptions(digits=3)\ntelecom1 <- read.table(\"../datasets/Telecom1.csv\", sep=\",\",header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE, dec = \".\") #read data\nsummary(telecom1)\n```\n  - We see that this dataset has three variables (or parameters) and few data points (18)\n    + size: the independent variable\n    + effort: the dependent variable\n    + EstTotal: the estimates coming from an estimation method\n  - Basic Plots\n```{r}\npar(mfrow=c(1,2)) #n figures per row\nsize_telecom1 <- telecom1$size\neffort_telecom1 <- telecom1$effort\n\nhist(size_telecom1, col=\"blue\", xlab='size', ylab = 'Probability', main = 'Histogram of project Size')\nlines(density(size_telecom1, na.rm = T, from = 0, to = max(size_telecom1)))\nplot(density(size_telecom1))\n\n\nhist(effort_telecom1, col=\"blue\")\nplot(density(effort_telecom1))\n\nboxplot(size_telecom1)\nboxplot(effort_telecom1)\n\n# violin plots for those two variables\nlibrary(vioplot)\nvioplot(size_telecom1, names = '') \ntitle(\"Violin Plot of Project Size\")\nvioplot(effort_telecom1, names = '')\ntitle(\"Violin Plot of Project Effort\")\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\nqqnorm(size_telecom1, main=\"Q-Q Plot of 'size'\")\nqqline(size_telecom1, col=2, lwd=2, lty=2) #draws a line through the first and third quartiles\nqqnorm(effort_telecom1,  main=\"Q-Q Plot of 'effort'\")\nqqline(effort_telecom1)\n```\n  - We observe the non-normality of the data. \n  \n  - We may look the posible relationship between size and effort with a scatterplot\n  \n```{r}\nplot(size_telecom1, effort_telecom1)\n```\n\n\n## China dataset \n\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(foreign)\nchina <- read.arff(\"../datasets/china.arff\")\nchina_size <- china$AFP\nsummary(china_size)\nchina_effort <- china$Effort\nsummary(china_effort)\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nhist(china_size, col=\"blue\", xlab=\"Adjusted Function Points\", main=\"Distribution of AFP\")\nhist(china_effort, col=\"blue\",xlab=\"Effort\", main=\"Distribution of Effort\")\nboxplot(china_size)\nboxplot(china_effort)\nqqnorm(china_size)\nqqline(china_size)\nqqnorm(china_effort)\nqqline(china_effort)\n```\n  - We observe the non-normality of the data. \n\n## Normality. Galton data\n  - It is the data based on the famous 1885 Francis Galton's study about the relationship between the heights of adult children and the heights of their parents.\n\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\n# library(UsingR); data(galton)\ngalton <- read.csv(\"../datasets/galton.csv\")\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nhist(galton$child,col=\"blue\") #,breaks=100)\nhist(galton$parent,col=\"blue\") #,breaks=100)\n```\n\n\n## Normalization\n\n  - China dataset. Take logs in both independent variables. \n  \n  \n```{r, echo=FALSE}\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nlogchina_size = log(china_size)\nhist(logchina_size, col=\"blue\", xlab=\"log Adjusted Function Points\", main=\"Distribution of log AFP\")\nlogchina_effort = log(china_effort)\nhist(logchina_effort, col=\"blue\",xlab=\"Effort\", main=\"Distribution of log Effort\")\nqqnorm(logchina_size)\nqqnorm(logchina_effort)\n```\n\n\n- If the log-log transformation is used the estimation equation is $$y= e^{b_0 + b_1 log(x)} $$\n\n## China dataset. Correlation. \n\n  - **Correlation** is a statistical relationship between two sets of data.\n  - With the whole dataset we may check for the linear Correlation of the variables we are interested in\n  \n  \n```{r}\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\nplot(china_size,china_effort)\ncor(china_size,china_effort)\ncor.test(china_size,china_effort)\ncor(china_size,china_effort, method=\"spearman\")\ncor(china_size,china_effort, method=\"kendall\")\n```\n\n",
