# Data Analysis in Software Engineering (DASE)

Javier Dolado and Daniel Rodriguez

(DRAFT `r Sys.Date()`)


This course covers sereral aspects of data analysis in Software Engieering (SE) and is been created by [Javier Dolado](www.sc.ehu.eus/jiwdocoj/) at the [University of the Basque Country](www.ehu.eus) and [Daniel Rodriguez](http://www.cc.uah.es/drg) at the [University of Alcala](http://www.uah.es/).

It is mainly based on [R](http://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) but we will also show some examples in [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) and other packages. It is structured as follows:

   + Data Normalisation
   
4 [Exploratory Data Analysis](./sections/exploratoryDataAnalysis.Rmd)

   + Visualization
   
5 [Descriptive Statistics](./sections/descriptiveStatistics.Rmd)

6 [Basic Model Building](./sections/basicModelBuilding.Rmd) (Machine Learning Techniques)

   + Supervised
      + Regression and classification

   + Other approaches
   
7 [Evaluation](./sections/evaluation.Rmd)

   - Descriptive statistics
   - Evaluation measures in machine learning
   - Graphical evaluation techniques (ROC and other visual evaluation techniques)
   
   - [Evaluation in Software Engineering](./sections/evaluationInSoftEng.Rmd)
   
8 [Advanced Model Building](advancedModelBuilding.Rmd) (Advanced algorithms)

  - Metalearners
  - Hybrid approaches
    
9 [Advanced Preprocessing Techniques](./sections/advancedPreprocessingTechniques.Rmd)

   + Noise
   + Feature Selection and Instance Selection
   + Imbalance
   + Missing values (Imputation methods)
