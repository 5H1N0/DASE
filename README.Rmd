# Data Analysis in Software Engineering (DASE)

Javier Dolado and Daniel Rodriguez

(Draft `r Sys.Date()`)


This course covers sereral aspects of data analysis in Software Engieering (SE) and is been created by [Javier Dolado](www.sc.ehu.es/jiwdocoj/) at the [University of the Basque Country](www.ehu.eus) and [Daniel Rodriguez]() at the [University of Alcala](http://www.uah.es/).

It is mainly based on [R](http://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio] (http://www.rstudio.com/). 

We will also show examples in Weka and other packages.

It is structured as follows.
