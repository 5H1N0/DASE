# Data Analysis in Software Engineering (DASE)

Javier Dolado and Daniel Rodriguez

(DRAFT - Not ready yet `r Sys.Date()`)


This course covers sereral aspects of data analysis in Software Engieering (SE) and is been created by [Javier Dolado](www.sc.ehu.eus/jiwdocoj/) at the [University of the Basque Country](www.ehu.eus) and [Daniel Rodriguez](http://www.cc.uah.es/drg) at the [University of Alcala](http://www.uah.es/).

It is mainly based on [R](http://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) but we will also show some examples in [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) and other packages. [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) can be compiled to html (and other formats) with RStudio's Knit.

It is structured as follows:

1 [Introduction to data analysis and model building](./sections/intro.Rmd)

2 [Data Sources](./sections/dataSources.Rmd)

   - Sources of information
   - Public repositories in software engineering
   
3 [Preprocessing Techniques](./sections/basicPreprocessing.Rmd)

   + Data types
   + Data Cleaning (duplicates, imbalance, noise)

4 [Exploratory Data Analysis](./sections/exploratoryDataAnalysis.Rmd)

   + Visualization
   
5 [Descriptive Statistics](./sections/descriptiveStatistics.Rmd)

6 [Basic Model Building](./sections/basicModelBuilding.Rmd) (Machine Learning Techniques)

   + Unsupervised
      + Clustering
      + Association rules
      
   + Other approaches
      + Weak Classification, Semi-supervised learning
