abstract="In this article, we present a systematic mapping study of replications in software engineering. The goal is to plot the landscape of current published replications of empirical studies in software engineering research. We applied the systematic review method to search and select published articles, and to extract and synthesize data from the selected articles that reported replications. Our search retrieved more than 16,000 articles, from which we selected 96 articles, reporting 133 replications performed between 1994 and 2010, of 72 original studies. Nearly 70 {\%} of the replications were published after 2004 and 70 {\%} of these studies were internal replications. The topics of software requirements, software construction, and software quality concentrated over 55 {\%} of the replications, while software design, configuration management, and software tools and methods were the topics with the smallest number of replications. We conclude that the number of replications has grown in the last few years, but the absolute number of replications is still small, in particular considering the breadth of topics in software engineering. We still need incentives to perform external replications, better standards to report empirical studies and their replications, and collaborative research agendas that could speed up development and publication of replications.",
