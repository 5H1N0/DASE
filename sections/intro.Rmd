We will deal with extracting information from data, either for estimation, defect prediction, planning, etc. 

We will provide an overview of data analsyis using different techniques. 

## What is Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)

The non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data [@FayyadPS1996]

![KDD Process](../figures/Fayyad96kdd-process.png)

The Cross Industry Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM, 1996) also provides a common and well-developed framework for delivering data mining projects identifying six steps:


  1. Problem Understanding
  2. Data Understanding
  3. Data Preparation
  4. Modeling
  5. Evaluation
  6. Deployment

## The Aim of Data Analysis and Statistical Learning
  - The aim of any data analysis is to  **understand the data** 
  - and to build models for making predictions and estimating future events based on past data
  - and to make statistical inferences from our data.
  - We may want to test different hypothesis on the data
  - We want to generate conclusions about the population where our sample data comes from
  - Most probably we are interested in building a model for quality, time, defects or effort prediction

  - We want to find a function *f()*, that given X1, X2, ...  computes *Y=f(X1, X2, ..., Xn)*
