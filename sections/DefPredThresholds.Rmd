## Use of Mean and Standard Deviation 

Some of the methods proposed in the literature suggest that the threshold for a given measure $X$ should be based on its distribution. 

More specifically, both Erni and Lewerentz [10] and Lanza and Marinescu [19] describe methods to define thresholds based on the mean value and the standard deviation of measures. 

As an applicability precondition, both proposals assume that X follows a normal distribution.
According to [10], the interval $[\mu − \sigma, \mu + \sigma]$ is regarded as the central range of “normal” values for $X$, where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the average and the standard deviation of the distribution of $X$, respectively.

The proposal of [19] takes μ − σ as the “low” threshold, μ + σ as the “high” threshold, and 1.5(μ + σ) as the “very high” threshold. In addition, the proposal suggests the use of “meaningful” thresholds, which can be derived based on

(1) commonly-used fraction thresholds (e.g., 0.75) and 

(2) thresholds with generally-accepted meaning, μ − σ and μ + σ.


## Use of Weighted Benchmark Data

Alves et al. use data from multiple different software sys-
tems to derive thresholds that are expected to “(i) bring out
the metric’s variability between systems and (ii) help focus
on a reasonable percentage of the source code volume” [2].


## Use of Quantiles
