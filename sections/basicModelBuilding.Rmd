# Basic Model Building

Data mining techniques can be grouped into predictive (supervised) and descriptive (unsupervised) depending on the problem at hand.

For example, in fault prediction, it would correspond to the generation of classification models to predict whether a software module will be defective based on metrics from historical project data. In the case of predicting a numeric value, it is a regression problem, e.g. effort and cost estimation.

A classification problem can be defined as the induction, from a dataset $\cal D$, of a classification function $\psi$ that, given the attribute vector of an instance/example, returns a class ${c}$. A regression problem, on the other hand, returns an numeric value.

Dataset, $\cal D$, is typically composed of $n$ attributes and a class attribute $C$. 

| $Att_1$  | ... | Attn | C   |
|----------|-----| -----|-----|
| $a_{11}$ | ... | a1n  | c1  |
| $a_{21}$ | ... | a2n  | c2  |
| ...      | ... | ...  | ... |
| $a_{m1}$ | ... | amn  | cm  |

Columns are usually called attributes and there is class attribute, binay (two values) or multi-label.

From the predictive (unsupervised) point of view, patterns are found to predict future behaviour or estimate. For example, association rules or clustering.



## Predictive problems

### Linear Regression
  - This procedure fits a straight line to the data. The idea is that the independent variable x is something the experimenter controls and the dependent variable y is something that the experimenter measures. The line is used to predict the value of y for a known value of x. The variable x is the predictor variable and y the response variable.
  - First proposed many years ago. But still very useful ...

  - The equation takes the form $\hat{y}=b_0+b_1 * x$
  - The method used to choose the values $b_0$ and $b_1$ is to minimize the sum of the squares of the residual errors.

## Galton Data

```{r}
library(UsingR); data(galton)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(galton$child,col="blue",breaks=100)
hist(galton$parent,col="blue",breaks=100)
plot(galton$parent,galton$child,pch=1,col="blue", cex=0.4)
lm1 <- lm(galton$child ~ galton$parent)
lines(galton$parent,lm1$fitted,col="red",lwd=3)
plot(galton$parent,lm1$residuals,col="blue",pch=1, cex=0.4)
abline(c(0,0),col="red",lwd=3)
qqnorm(galton$child)
```

  
## Linear Regression Diagnostics

  - Several plots help to evaluate the suitability of the linear regression 
    + *Residuals vs fitted*: The residuals should be randomly distributed around the horizontal line representing a residual error of zero; that is, there should not be a distinct trend in the distribution of points. 
    + *Standard Q-Q plot*: residual errors are normally distributed
    + *Square root of the standardized residuals vs the fitted value*s: there should be no obvious trend.
    + *Leverage*: measures the importance of each point in determining the regression result. Smaller values means that removing the observation has little effect on the regression result. 

## China dataset. Linear regression. Fitting a linear model to log-log
  - the predictive power equation is $y= e^{b_0 + b_1 log(x)}$, ignoring the bias corrections
  - First, we are fitting the model to the whole dataset. But it is not the right way to do it, because of overfitting.



```{r}
library(foreign)
china <- read.arff("../datasets/china.arff")
china_size <- china$AFP
summary(china_size)
china_effort <- china$Effort
summary(china_effort)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(china_size, col="blue", xlab="Adjusted Function Points", main="Distribution of AFP")
hist(china_effort, col="blue",xlab="Effort", main="Distribution of Effort")
boxplot(china_size)
boxplot(china_effort)
qqnorm(china_size)
qqline(china_size)
qqnorm(china_effort)
qqline(china_effort)
```
  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
logchina_size = log(china_size)
hist(logchina_size, col="blue", xlab="log Adjusted Function Points", main="Distribution of log AFP")
logchina_effort = log(china_effort)
hist(logchina_effort, col="blue",xlab="Effort", main="Distribution of log Effort")
qqnorm(logchina_size)
qqnorm(logchina_effort)
```
  
  
  
```{r}
linmodel_logchina <- lm(logchina_effort ~ logchina_size)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(logchina_size, logchina_effort)
abline(linmodel_logchina, lwd=3, col=3)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(linmodel_logchina, ask = FALSE)
linmodel_logchina
```


## Supervised Classification


Here we will use defect prediction as ensample of several machine learning techniques.

The caret (Classification And REgression Training) package provides a unified interface for modeling and prediction with around 150 different models with tools for:

+ data splitting
+ pre-processing
+ feature selection
+ model tuning using resampling
+ variable importance estimation, etc.
